"""Byte parity for PAGE, which had a text check and no hash.

``docs/promises.md`` graded this row **"partielle, proche d'aucune" — texte
seulement, aucun sha256**, next to an ALTO row that has had pinned digests and
a classified diff history since v1.0. So the format where the rewrite drops
the most markup was the one nothing pinned at the byte level.

What makes the digests here worth having rather than ceremonial is that the
diff is **classified**, not merely frozen. Measured on 2026-08-17 over both
real PAGE fixtures, with the identity and scripted scenarios ALTO already
uses:

============  ==========  =========  ==================================
fixture       scenario    bytes      element census vs source
============  ==========  =========  ==================================
Descartes     identity    131791     **unchanged**
Descartes     scripted    113204     ``Word`` -47, and its four children
LaFayette     identity     29000     **unchanged**
LaFayette     scripted     26163     ``Word`` -7, and its four children
============  ==========  =========  ==================================

Two things follow, and both are asserted below rather than left to the hash.

**The identity run changes no element at all.** Its 20 extra bytes are the
provenance stamp. That assertion survives a deliberate provenance change,
which a digest does not — so it is the one that keeps meaning after the next
justified hash update.

**Every dropped ``Word`` is counted.** ``words_dropped`` equals the number of
``<Word>`` elements missing from the output, exactly, on both fixtures. That
is the `R*` promise — every alteration declared and counted — cross-checked
between the report and the delivered bytes, which nothing did for PAGE. A
digest would have frozen an uncounted drop just as happily as a counted one.

**Why dropping them is principled**, since 47 elements is a visible loss: the
line-level text is authoritative, and in these files it already disagrees
with its own words. Measured, because "the fixtures disagree" is the sort of
claim that should not be asserted from the shape of the code — 31 of 32 lines
in the Descartes page and 10 of 13 in the LaFayette one, and only one of the
41 by spacing alone. The line reads ``ſciences … richeſſes`` where its words
read ``fciences … richesses``; another reads ``8 Discours.`` against
``L Discours.``. Two transcriptions of one line in one file. Keeping stale
words beside a corrected line would deliver a contradiction; dropping and
counting them is the documented remedy.

**A wrinkle named rather than pinned.** ``line_word_disagreement`` is that
measurement, and its own comment in the rewriter calls it a *diagnostic*. It
lands in ``format_losses`` — the field for what the run lost — so an identity
run whose element census is provably unchanged still reports 31 "losses". It
is the mirror image of a phantom loss: a true observation about the source,
published under a heading that means something else. Moving it changes the
report's shape, which is an arbitration like the one open on `#108`, so this
file makes the fact visible and leaves the move to that decision.
