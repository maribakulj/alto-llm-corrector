"""An equal word count does not make positional pairing correct.

The ALTO rewriter has a fast path: when the corrected line has as many
words as the line has ``String`` children, it rewrites ``CONTENT`` in
place and leaves every other attribute alone. That is the path that keeps
geometry, identity and ``STYLEREFS`` byte-identical, and it is worth
having.

Its premise is that word *i* corresponds to ``String`` *i*. The rewriter
states the opposite promise a hundred lines further down — *identity
follows the word it corresponds to, never whatever sat at the same
position* — and only the **slow path** keeps it, by aligning tokens.

**A correction can keep the count and move the boundary.** ``au`` +
``jourdhui`` corrected to ``aujourd`` + ``hui`` is two words before and
two words after; a word-splitting rule over OCR spacing does this on
every page it touches. Measured on 2026-08-17, before the guard:

    S1 CONTENT='aujourd'  WIDTH=60   ->   8.6 units per character
    S2 CONTENT='hui'      WIDTH=820  -> 273.3 units per character
    rewriter_path='fast_path'  fidelity=EXACT  losses=None

Seven characters in the box drawn for two, ``STYLEREFS`` swapped with
them, and the report claims the strongest thing the fidelity scale can
say — because the reconstructed *text* does equal the decision. **The
fidelity check reads text; it is blind to which box a word landed in.**

Who pays: any consumer that crops line images from the geometry. That
includes this library's own vision producer, which would read the wrong
slice of the scan and be told the projection was exact.

After the guard, same line: 84.9 and 85.0 units per character.
