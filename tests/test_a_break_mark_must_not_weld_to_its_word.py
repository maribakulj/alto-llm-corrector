"""A break mark must not weld to the word before it. Closed 2026-08-19.

Found by a real Mistral run over 20 Gallica newspaper pages on 2026-08-17:
one page produced **no output at all**, killed by ``ProjectionError``.

    rewritten XML for 'alto.xml' diverges from the run's decision on line
    'PAG_1_TL000441': decided 'à la révision des jugements et d -' but the
    artefact contains 'à la révision des jugements et d-'

The space between ``d`` and the break mark was gone, so the file said
something the run did not decide. Refusing to deliver was correct — the
projection invariant was doing its job. The defect was upstream of it, and
what it cost was not a space: the words diverge, so
``classify_projection_fidelity`` returns ``None``, and nothing between there
and ``run()`` catches it. **One line lost the whole document** — every other
file, and the ``CorrectionReport`` with its traces along with them.

**Not the rare accident it looked like.** The shape — an explicit
``HypPart1`` whose last ``String`` is the break mark itself, preceded by an
``<SP>``, with a ``<HYP>`` after — occurs on 29 of the 24 694 lines in the
54 real Gallica files, which sounds negligible until you count files: **10
of 35 carry at least one**, and all ten belong to two issues
(``bpt6k4607951t``, ``bpt6k46079527``). It is a producer signature, not a
scatter. For a holding digitised by that chain the failure rate is not 0.12%
of lines, it is most of the files. And those 29 lines read
``"g'.e :.:;r.. --"``, ``"1K' --"`` — precisely the lines a corrector
restructures, so the odds of triggering GIVEN the shape are high.

**Why it stayed open for two days, and why that reason was wrong.** This
docstring used to say the fix "touches the geometry, and writing bad
geometry into a delivered file is worse than the lost space". Both halves
turned out to be false. The geometry is free: the ``<SP>`` is carved OUT of
the slot already reserved for the ``<HYP>``, so no other token moves and the
children still tile the line exactly.

**The real obstacle, which nobody had named.** A first fix read the trailing
whitespace off the text inside ``_rebuild_line`` — and broke
``test_f6_no_whitespace_geometry_unchanged``, a declared property saying an
edge space must not move the geometry. The two are not in conflict; they are
about different spaces, which ``_drop_structural_break_hyphen`` already
tells apart and the rebuild no longer can:

    'deux mots- '   space AFTER the mark, noise   ->  'deux mots'
    'et d -'        space BEFORE it, the source's ->  'et d '

By the time the rebuild sees the text the mark is gone and both merely "end
in whitespace". The information is not recoverable there — so it travels, as
``space_before_break``, from the one place that sees the text on both sides
of the drop. ``F6`` is untouched.
