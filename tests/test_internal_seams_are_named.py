"""Which internals the suite is allowed to reach, and why each one.

`RM-05b` recorded "277 private-symbol imports from tests/" as debt. Measured
here rather than repeated: **64 imports, 38 symbols, 32 files**, and most of
them are not debt at all. The count was never the problem. The problem is
that nothing said WHICH internals are load-bearing, so when `S1` renames one,
the breakage is ambiguous — was the test too intimate, or did an invariant
just lose its net?

This map answers that, per symbol, in four categories:

``surface``
    Not an internal. The public-API snapshot test needs the lazy map to
    check the lazy map, and ``__version__`` is a dunder.

``alias``
    A PUBLIC function wearing an underscore. ``formats/_xml.py`` exports
    ``detect_namespace``; both format packages re-export it as
    ``_detect_namespace`` by local convention and list it in their own
    ``__all__``. Twelve of the sixty-four imports are this one name. The
    underscore is a naming artifact, not a boundary.

``value``
    A function of its arguments (or a constant). The test calls it and
    reads what it returns, or what it wrote on an object the TEST owns —
    an ``lxml`` element it built, a list of lines it built. Reaching it
    directly is a unit test, not a trespass: routing the same assertion
    through the façade would need a whole document and would assert less.

``run-state``
    A pass that writes the RUN's state — the per-line traces, the decision
    order. These are load-bearing by construction, and the plan already
    says why: the public suite "checks the FINAL state of a run, not its
    dependence on pass order" (`RM-05a`). Rename one and a test must break;
    that is the point of it.

**The classification is verified, not declared.** A ``run-state`` entry has
to carry ``traces``, ``workspace`` or ``order`` in its real signature, read
from ``src/``, and a ``value`` entry has to carry none of them; an ``alias``
entry has to genuinely be an aliased import in the module it is imported
from. Mislabelling fails here. One entry is a class rather than a function
(``_RetryDecision``) and carries no signature to check — it is named with a
reason and nothing more, which is the honest limit of this test.

What this file deliberately does NOT do is shrink the number. There is no
bucket of gratuitous imports to remove: the audit's premise was wrong, and
the useful artefact is a bounded, named list.
