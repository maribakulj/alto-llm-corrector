"""Driving one page through the producer, chunk by chunk.

The engine's inner loop, and until now the bulk of the orchestrator: plan a
page's chunks, route them, run each one, retry it, descend a granularity
when retrying at this one is hopeless, and decide what its ending does to
its lines. None of that is what a *pipeline* does — a pipeline preflights,
indexes, drives, finalises, renders and reports. This is what the fourth of
those means.

:class:`PageDriver` is built once per run from the engine's immutable
configuration, so the loop reads its policies off a value rather than off
the public façade. It owns no run state: the mutable
:class:`~lidenbrock.core.context.RunContext` is threaded in per call, and a
driver can therefore serve every page of a run — or two concurrent runs —
without the two contaminating each other.
