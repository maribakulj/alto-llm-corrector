"""What a chunk's ending does to its lines.

A chunk ends in exactly three ways, and each writes a different terminal
state onto the same lines:

  - :func:`_finish_successful_chunk` — the producer answered and the
    validator accepted: reconcile the hyphen units, run the acceptance
    guard, project the result onto the traces;
  - :func:`_apply_chunk_fallback` — the retry budget ran out, or the
    error was one smaller chunks would hit identically: the targets go
    back to their OCR text;
  - :func:`_absorb_chunk_error` — a recoverable domain error interrupted
    the chunk somewhere in the middle: whatever it left undecided goes
    back to OCR text NOW.

They live together because the third one is easy to forget, and forgetting
it is how a run finishes "successfully" with lines in no state at all. It
used to sit inline in the page loop, fifty lines deep inside an ``except``,
where nothing suggested it was a sibling of the fallback path.

Two invariants they share, and neither is optional:

  - **F8 — only TARGET lines.** Context lines were sent to the producer for
    context and belong to an adjacent chunk; forcing them here would steal
    a decision from the window where their context is maximal.
  - **ADR-010 — a fallback covers the whole hyphen unit.** Intra-page
    partners are co-targets by planner atomicity, so the closure only ever
    ADDS cross-page members — the partner whose own chunk succeeded (or has
    not run yet) is pulled to OCR too, rather than leaving a joined word
    rewritten on one line and verbatim on the other.

Free functions (S2). The engine supplies its guard config and its observer
callback; nothing here reads a pipeline.
