"""Pure correction pipeline.

The pipeline takes a parsed :class:`DocumentManifest`, drives the chunk
planner, asks the injected :class:`EditProducer` for an
:class:`EditScript` per chunk, validates the result, reconciles hyphen
pairs, and renders the corrected XML in memory. It depends only on the
Protocols in :mod:`corrigenda.core.protocols` — no job store, no
FastAPI, no filesystem path manipulation beyond reading source files.
Credentials never reach the pipeline: an LLM's API key lives inside its
producer (see :class:`LLMEditProducer` and the
:meth:`CorrectionPipeline.for_provider` convenience).

Side effects:
  - producer calls via :class:`EditProducer` (LLM HTTP, rules engine, …)
  - Event notifications via :class:`PipelineObserver`

The engine never persists (ADR-011): the corrected artefacts, the §9
report and the run's statistics all travel on
:class:`CorrectionResult`; the caller persists them
(:meth:`CorrectionResult.write`, or its own transaction).

        client with no ``list_models`` is fully supported (model
        discovery is application vocabulary, see ``ModelCatalog``).

        Composition-boundary convenience: wraps the provider + credentials
        + prompt contract into an ``LLMEditProducer`` so callers migrating
        from the legacy ``run(api_key=…, model=…, provider_name=…)`` keep a
        one-call setup. The import is function-local — this is one of the
        two pinned lazy composition sites the import-contract test allows
        in core (the other is the adapter resolution in
        ``_render_outputs``).

        The named parameters here are the ones this constructor OWNS —
        the vendor call (``provider``, ``api_key``, ``model``,
        ``provider_name``) and the prompt contract it hands the producer
        (``system_prompt``, ``output_schema``, ``uncertainty_channel``,
        ``lexicon``) — plus ``observer``, which is kept named for a reason
        worth stating: it is REQUIRED by ``__init__``, so forwarding it
        would move the error from this call site into the constructor,
        turning a missing-argument message about ``for_provider`` into one
        about a function the caller did not call. Optional configuration
        has no such problem and goes through ``**pipeline_kwargs``
        (`RM-03`).

        It used to re-declare all thirteen and copy them across by hand,
        which is not merely long: the copy is a SECOND declaration of the
        constructor's signature, and nothing made the two agree. A knob
        added to ``__init__`` and forgotten here was silently unreachable
        through this door, and a default drifting apart between the two
        would have been invisible in review. Forwarding removes the class
        of bug; ``tests/test_public_api_snapshot.py`` pins both signatures
        so the loss of explicitness stays visible where consumers read it.

        ``document_manifest``: the input is read, never written, so the
        same document object can be run again (or concurrently) and
        every run starts from the original OCR text. All per-run state
        lives in a fresh :class:`RunContext` plus that copy; the
        instance carries only immutable configuration, so one pipeline
        instance supports concurrent ``run()`` calls (within one event
        loop — instances are still not thread-safe). The run's
        decisions are returned on the result
        (:attr:`CorrectionResult.decisions`), not written back onto the
        caller's manifest.

        §5.1 resorption — there is no ``api_key``/``model``/``provider_name``
        here anymore: credentials and the vendor call live inside the
        injected :class:`EditProducer` (see :meth:`for_provider`), and the
        provenance labels are constructor state.

        ``page_images`` (§5.1) — optional mapping of **page_id** (document-
        unique, ADR-007) to a :data:`PageImage`: the historical opaque
        :data:`ImageRef` (str) or the richer, recommended
        :class:`~corrigenda.core.schemas.ImageAsset` — one image per
        physical page, so a multipage XML carries one ref per scan. The
        library forwards each page's ref verbatim into the producer payload
        when the producer asks (``wants_image``) and NEVER opens it (I4).
        A ``wants_image`` producer run without a complete mapping raises
        :class:`ConfigurationError` before any work starts; a key matching
        no page (e.g. a legacy file-name key) is refused explicitly.

        ``run_id`` is an optional identifier embedded in the emitted
        :class:`CorrectionReport` (which is also what ``trace.json``
        contains) so consumers can correlate the persisted report with
        their own job/request id. Generated as a uuid4 when omitted; it
        never leaks back into the public events.

        ``should_abort`` (F10) is an optional cancellation probe. It is
        polled between pages and between chunks; when it returns ``True``
        the run raises :class:`CorrectionAborted` and no result is
        produced. A provider call already in flight is not interrupted —
        cancellation is cooperative and observed only at chunk/page
        boundaries.

        :meth:`CorrectionResult.write` for the simple case, or a
        host-owned transaction (like the demo backend's staging writer)
        when the host needs commit/discard semantics.
