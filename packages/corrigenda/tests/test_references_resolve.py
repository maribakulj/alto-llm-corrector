"""A reference the code makes must resolve, and must still resolve later.

Two vocabularies are legitimate in a source comment, and the repository
rule (CONTRIBUTING.md, `docs/adr/README.md`) says why: code comments state
the invariant, ADRs hold the genealogy, and the spec holds the contract.

  * ``ADR-NNN`` — a file under ``docs/adr/``.
  * ``§n`` — a numbered section of ``SPECS_LIB_V2.md``.

`ADR-012` was cited seventeen times across `core` and both format packages
while `docs/adr/` stopped at 011, and the index stopped at 008 while
009-011 existed on disk. Neither is a typo anyone would catch by reading:
a citation reads as authoritative precisely because it looks resolvable,
and an index reads as complete precisely because it is an index.

Everything else the code cites is **work-item vocabulary**: the row of a
plan, the finding of an audit, the slice of a wave. It resolves for as long
as someone remembers which plan, and then it stops — three of the four
families below already point into ``docs/history/``, which is frozen by
`CLAUDE.md` and must never be updated to match the code. A reader who
cannot resolve the tag has been told nothing; a reader who can has been
told where the change came from, which is not what a comment is for.

So the tags go and the knowledge stays. That trade is the whole point: a
comment reading ``F8 — only TARGET lines`` loses nothing by becoming ``Only
TARGET lines``, and a comment whose entire content is ``(S2)`` was never
carrying any.

The families, and where each one used to point:

  ``F<nn>``      spec-review findings — ``docs/history/PLAN-CORRECTIONS.md``
  ``P3.<n>``     slices of the v3 roadmap — ``docs/history/ROADMAP_LIB_V3.md``
  ``S/L/R<n>``   rows of ``docs/PLAN.md``, archived as each one closes
  ``slice <X>``  wave slices, admissible ONLY next to the ADR that defines
                 them (``ADR-011 slice E`` resolves; a bare ``slice E``
                 does not)
  ``Audit-…``,   the audit trail, which CONTRIBUTING.md already keeps out of
  ``wave <n>``   new code comments

`RM-<nn>` is deliberately NOT in that list. The remediation wave is in
flight and its rows are live in ``docs/PLAN.md``; those tags are swept when
the wave closes, by the session that closes it.
