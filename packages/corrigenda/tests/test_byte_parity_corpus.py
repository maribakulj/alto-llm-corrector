"""Byte-parity gate on the non-regression corpus (spec §13 DoD, v1.0).

Same inputs → same output bytes. Two deterministic scenarios over the two
corpus files, pinned by sha256:

  - **identity** — every line corrected with its own OCR text. Verified
    BYTE-IDENTICAL to the pre-v1.0 baseline (commit 8c4789c) during the
    post-audit parity run: F4 only widens the UNTOUCHED path and F2/F6
    never fire without a content change.
  - **scripted** — deterministic corrections exercising the fast path
    (every 3rd line: first 'e' → '3', same word count) and the slow path
    (every 7th line: ' zz' appended). Versus the same baseline, the only
    differing TextLines were classified as the DOCUMENTED v1.0 changes:
    F2 (WC/CC dropped on changed Strings) and F6/§6.1 (rebalanced
    slow-path String+SP geometry). No text drift, no structure drift.

    Audit-D rev (2026-07-12) — the scripted hashes moved again, classified
    per TextLine: the ONLY diff is that a slow-path rebuild of an explicit
    PART1/BOTH line now emits its trailing ``<HYP>`` with the reserved
    end-of-line geometry (HPOS/VPOS/WIDTH/HEIGHT flush to the line's right
    edge) instead of a geometry-less ``<HYP CONTENT="-"/>``. This is the
    rewriter.py #16 fix: the HYP fills its reserved slot so the child
    widths sum exactly to the line WIDTH and nothing overlaps the last
    String. String/SP geometry, text, CONTENT and structure are byte-
    identical; the identity hashes are unchanged (the rebuild path never
    fires without a word-count change).

    Double-hyphen fix (2026-07-21) — the two SCRIPTED hashes moved again
    (identity hashes unchanged: identity takes the UNTOUCHED path, which the
    fix never touches). An explicit PART1 line carries its break hyphen in
    the <HYP> element; when the LLM returns the fragment WITH a trailing
    hyphen ("préve-"), the rewriter stored it in the last String CONTENT too,
    doubling it. The fix drops that trailing hyphen from the write text on
    explicit PART1 lines only. Classified: after the fix, ZERO explicit PART1
    lines in either corpus carry a doubled hyphen; heuristic PART1 (no
    HYP/SUBS markup) keeps its trailing dash in CONTENT, unchanged.

    Provenance fix (2026-07-21) — all four hashes moved by exactly one
    localized, deterministic change: the rewriter now records the correction
    pass as a ``<postProcessingStep>`` inside the file's existing
    ``<OCRProcessing>`` container. Previously ``_add_processing_entry`` only
    handled the ALTO 4.0 generic ``<Processing>`` element and silently wrote
    NOTHING for real OCR files (both corpus fixtures use ``<OCRProcessing>``),
    breaking §11's "every corrected file records the pass". Classified per
    subtree: the original ``<ocrProcessingStep>`` (Tesseract / ABBYY) is
    preserved untouched; the ONLY addition is the appended
    ``<postProcessingStep>``. No TextLine, String, SP, HYP, text or geometry
    drift — the identity path still never rebuilds a line.

If a hash moves, do NOT regenerate blindly: re-run the classifier
(scratch parity_classify.py pattern — parse both outputs, diff per
TextLine, bucket into text/structure/confidence/geometry) and update the
hash ONLY for a deliberate, documented byte change, naming it in the
commit message. The rewrite is invoked WITHOUT provenance arguments so
these hashes are independent of the library version string.

    Mixed-role break fix (2026-07-27) — ONE scripted hash moved
    (``X0000002.xml``; the other three are unchanged, and identity is
    untouched because it takes the UNTOUCHED path). Classified per TextLine:
    **exactly 1 of 566 differs**, ``PAG_00000002_TL000454``, whose last
    String goes from ``Wal`` back to ``Wal-``. Nothing else in the file
    changes — not geometry, not attributes, not structure.

    That line is BOTH: it opens with an explicit ``SUBS_TYPE="HypPart2"``
    and ends on a bare heuristic dash with no ``<HYP>``. The writer decided
    whether to strip the trailing mark from the String by reading
    ``hyphen_source_explicit`` — which describes the BACKWARD link — and got
    "explicit", so it dropped the dash expecting a ``<HYP>`` to render it.
    There is none, and the mark was simply gone from the delivered file. It
    now reads ``forward_break_is_explicit``, the role→slot map applied to
    the right flag. The old hash pinned the defect.
