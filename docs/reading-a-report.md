# Reading a run's report honestly

A `CorrectionReport` carries several numbers. Each answers a narrow question,
and the danger is not that any of them lies — it is that a reader takes one
for a broader claim than it makes. This page says, for each, what it means and
what it does **not**.

Written for the institutional case: someone deciding whether a corrected file
can be ingested, who needs to know what the run could not see.

## The one that misleads most: `fallback_lines == 0`

**Means:** no proposal was refused by the guards.

**Does not mean:** nothing was altered. It is close to the opposite — every
line the producer touched was *accepted*. A run where the model rewrote half
the document and the guards found nothing objectionable reports `0`.

To ask "what changed?", read the per-line outcomes: `decision.final_text`
against the source, or `projection.rewriter_path` (`untouched` is the only
value that means the line's markup was not rewritten at all).

## `review_lines`

**Means:** the run delivered this many corrections it has no means of
verifying. The lines are `review_required`, their text is the correction,
and the artefact carries it.

**Does not mean:** this many lines are wrong. The opposite is closer to the
truth. On the run that motivated the state, an empirical detector raised 56
lines with changed digits and nearly all of them were **good** corrections —
which could only be established against ground truth, and in production
there is none. What the number sizes is the library's own blind spot, not
the model's error rate.

**Also does not mean:** the remaining corrections are verified. `corrected`
means the guards found nothing objectionable, which is a much weaker claim
than "checked". A line can change a word into another perfectly ordinary
word at similarity 0.99 and no rule here sees it.

Read `review_reasons` for triage: the codes are ranked by nothing, but they
are not equally urgent. A changed digit in a price table and a respelled
surname are both unverifiable and only one of them will be read as fact.
One line can carry several codes, so the counts sum to at least
`review_lines`, never to it.

`ReviewPolicy.silent()` turns the whole thing off. It changes no delivered
byte — it removes the report, not the uncertainty.

## `format_losses is None`

**Means:** no markup was dropped — no element or attribute left the tree.

**Does not mean:** nothing was lost. A character the format cannot carry — a
no-break space, U+202F, a tab flattened to an ordinary space — is a loss of
TEXT, and it is counted on the fidelity scale instead. A run can report
`format_losses: None` and `projection_fidelity: {"normalized": 2}` at the same
time, and those two lines really did lose something a typographer would see.

Both fields have to be read. They are deliberately not mirrored into one
counter: two accounting sites for one event drift apart, which is a defect
this library has already had once.

## `projection_fidelity`

Per-line grades, counted over the run, best to worst:

| level | what it says |
|---|---|
| `exact` | the artefact says the decision, character for character |
| `source_spelling` | same words and same break, but the file spells a character its own way (a `<HYP>` holding U+00AD read back as `-`). **Nothing is lost** — the file is *more* specific than the decision |
| `token_equivalent` | same words, and every significant whitespace survived; only runs collapsed or edges were trimmed. This is what the format costs |
| `normalized` | a significant whitespace character was **replaced**. The line reads the same to a machine that splits on whitespace, and no longer reads the same to a typographer |

**Does not mean:** that the text is *right*. This scale compares the delivered
file against what the run DECIDED. A wrong decision faithfully written is
`exact`.

## `unpaired_breaks`

**Means:** N lines end mid-word with no partner this run could see — the
pairing policy refused the candidate, the partner is on a page this run does
not have, or the pointer dangles.

**Does not mean** the count is a defect count. A page whose last line ends in
a hyphen legitimately contributes 1. What it does mean is that those lines were
corrected **alone**, so their pair-drift guards never ran: they carry less
scrutiny than a paired line, not more error.

## `hyphen_splits`

**Means:** the planner **severed** a hyphen link to keep a chain inside one
request. Both sides keep their OCR text verbatim.

**Does not mean** a failure. It means a delivered line whose text still ends
mid-word and which now declares no break at all. Nothing else on the report
says this: it is not a fallback, not an unpaired break, and not a format loss.

Rare — it requires an over-cap chain *and* a chunk that failed its retries,
since the granularity descent is the only path that reaches LINE planning.

## `confidence_invalidated`

**Means:** N **lines** lost their OCR confidence: the source engine's `WC`/`CC`
(ALTO) or `@conf` (PAGE) were removed because a correction made them untrue.

**Does not mean** N attributes. The unit is the line, deliberately — per
occurrence it reaches four digits on a single page and tracks how wordy a line
is rather than anything you would act on.

## `word_order_suspected` (per line)

**Means:** the token alignment could not vouch for the word order it was
handed.

**Does not mean** a loss, and it is not counted as one. Nothing left the
markup; the correction is written exactly as decided, because lines never merge
and words never move. It is a flag for a human, never acted on.

## What no number on this report tells you

- **Whether the corrections are right.** Every guard in this library is
  structural: it refuses text that migrated between lines, words that grew past
  a threshold, a break mark that vanished. None of them knows French, or
  history, or your edition's conventions. A plausible, fluent, wrong reading
  passes every one.
- **Whether the guards are calibrated.** They are not, and the code says so —
  `GuardConfig`'s thresholds are safe defaults, not measured ones. They have
  been exercised on two corpora and one model family.
- **Whether the source OCR was any good.** `ocr_confidence` is preserved per
  line where the source carried it, and it is the *engine's* opinion of its own
  work.

## The short version

`0 fallback` means **no proposal was refused**. It does not mean nothing
changed, and it does not mean what changed was right. To audit a run you need
`projection_fidelity` and `format_losses` together, plus `unpaired_breaks` and
`hyphen_splits` for the lines that were corrected with less than the full set
of guards behind them.
