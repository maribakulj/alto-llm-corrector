"""What a run records about its own inputs and dependencies (§11).

Helpers the orchestrator used to carry: which format adapter serves a
document, which dependency versions were installed, the digest of every
source file, and the assembled provenance record itself. None of them
touches run state — the record is a function of the run's inputs and
the identities it was configured with, which is exactly why it does not
need the engine to build it.

    digest of another. Replayed against the file it names, it failed its own
    preconditions. The preflight now refuses a path whose bytes moved, so
    the stamp is both truthful and verified.

    Falls back to hashing when the manifest carries no stamp, which means it
