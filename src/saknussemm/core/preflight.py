"""Everything a run refuses BEFORE spending any correction work.

Six checks, and the reason they are one function rather than six scattered
guards is that they share a property: each turns a mid-run surprise into a
start-up error. A `source_files` mapping that does not describe the same
document as the manifest, a vision producer with no images, a producer whose
declared capabilities contradict its wiring, an injected adapter that
disagrees with the format the manifest was parsed as, a duplicate identity,
an image key matching no page — every one of them would otherwise fail late,
confusingly, with correction work already spent. The first of them would not
fail at all: it would report success over a document half of which reached
no artefact.

Lifted out of ``_run_impl``: the 311-line orchestrator opened with 60
lines that decide nothing about how the run proceeds, only whether it may
start at all.
