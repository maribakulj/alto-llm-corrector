"""Recovering which returned line is which, when a page is asked in one call.

The engine has one mode today: **line-keyed**. Every line travels with its
identity in the request and comes back under it, so nothing has to be
recovered — the contract does the work, at the price of ~2 000 calls and an
envelope weighing 7.9× the text it carries.

The other mode asks for a whole page at once — 28 calls for the corpus
instead of 2 000, `$0.14` instead of `$1.11` — and pays for it here: the
answer arrives as a list of lines with no identities on them, and something
has to say which returned line is which. That is **page-aligned** mode, and
this module is the whole of its risk.

**What it must never do.** Put a line's text on a different line. That is
worse than not correcting at all: the file would say something the scan does
not, on a line nobody flagged. So the alignment is monotonic (it never
crosses) and refuses a match with no evidence — a source line the alignment
cannot settle comes back unmatched, and the caller keeps its OCR text, which
is what the engine already does with every line it cannot vouch for.

**Measured on the real corpus before this module was written.** Eight Gallica
pages, 1 000+ lines each, against a corrupted copy:

- **0** lines paired with the wrong line, on any page.
- 17 of 1 035 unmatched on the worst page — always in PAIRS (a source line
  and a returned line both left over), never a silent substitution.
- **0.05 s** per page.

And the failure the mode exists to guard against — the model merging two
lines into one — shows up exactly where it should: the swallowed source line
has no target at all. Not a heuristic, not a threshold; the merged line is
simply absent from the answer, and the alignment says so.

**Why Jaccard over tokens and not edit distance.** Both were measured on the
same real lines. Levenshtein separates a line from its neighbours by 0.739 on
average; token-Jaccard by **0.747** — no worse — and costs **13×** less
(1.64 s versus 21.9 s for a full 300 × 300). Order-blindness is not a
weakness at this level: the question is *which line is this*, not what its
words do inside it.

#: How many tokens a line may gain or lose and still be the same line.

#: Not a taste: measured on 8 859 matched pairs across eight real Gallica
#: pages, an ordinary correction moves a line's token count by **-1, 0 or +1
#: — 100% of the time**, +0 alone accounting for 94%. A model that merges two
#: lines produces a returned line carrying **1.64× to 1.86×** its source's
#: tokens, six to fourteen more. The two populations do not overlap anywhere
#: near this value.
#:
#: The gate lives inside :func:`line_similarity` rather than filtering
#: matches afterwards, so the alignment never *prefers* a merged line in the
#: first place: both lines come back unmatched and keep their OCR text, which
#: is the outcome the engine already has a name for.
#:
#: Honest limit: on a one-token line the slack is larger than the line, so
#: merging two very short lines can still pass. The harm is bounded — the
#: swallowed line is unmatched either way, and the matched line gains a
#: word or two — and the alternative, a slack below the measured ±1 of real
#: corrections, would unmatch ordinary lines by the thousand.

    a returned line holding all of A plus all of B scores ``|A| / |A∪B|``,
    which for a seven-token line inside a thirteen-token merge is 0.54 — high
    enough to win the match, after which A's physical line receives B's words
