"""Immutable decision record of a run (ADR-011, slices C+E).

The engine expresses its decisions by mutating its PRIVATE working copy
of the manifests (the caller's document is never
touched); this module defines THE decision model and materializes it
exactly once — after the global consistency pass, when every line's
decision is final. Everything downstream of the run reads the
:class:`DecisionSet`: the projection invariant, fallback accounting,
the final EditScript, and — via :attr:`CorrectionResult.decisions` —
the caller itself.

Materialization enforces terminality: a ``PENDING`` line at this point
is an engine bug — a decision path that forgot its lines — never an
input problem, so the set refuses to exist and the run fails loudly
(the run-level backstop that previously sat beside the write path).

Pure core: no lxml, no formats import (import-contract test).
