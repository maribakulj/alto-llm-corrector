"""Format-agnostic XML helpers shared by every transcription format.

lxml lives here — so this module is NOT part of the pure ``core`` (the
import-contract test allows ``formats`` to import lxml) — but it is NOT a
format either: namespace detection, tag qualification, and the hardened
parser are identical for ALTO, PAGE, and any future format.

Homing them here keeps the format packages *siblings* — ``alto → _xml ←
page`` — instead of making one an accidental base that the other reaches
sideways into (the former ``page → alto`` edge, which meant deleting or
refactoring ALTO would break PAGE). Each format's ``_ns`` re-exports these
three under its existing private names, so call sites are unchanged.

    Gallica serves ALTO that declares ``ISO-8859-1`` and contains UTF-8.
    Read as declared, ``cléricales`` arrives as ``clÃ©ricales`` — and a
    post-OCR corrector handed that will dutifully *repair* it, delivering a
    text change that the report cannot distinguish from a correction. That
    is precisely the class of undeclared alteration this library exists to
    refuse, so the mismatch has to be caught at the door.

    Three conditions, all necessary:

    1. the declaration names a latin-family encoding;
    2. the WHOLE byte stream decodes as strict UTF-8;
    3. it contains at least one non-ASCII character — otherwise both
       readings are identical and there is nothing to decide.

    Condition 2 is close to a proof rather than a heuristic. In latin-1
    French, ``é`` is ``0xE9`` and the byte after it is a letter
    (``0x61``-``0x7A``); UTF-8 requires the byte following a lead byte to be
    ``0x80``-``0xBF``, which a letter never is. A genuine latin-1 document
    fails at its first accent. Measured on ten French words: ten failures.

    What would still fool it: a real latin-1 file in which *every* accented
    byte happens to be followed by a continuation byte. No such document is
    in hand, and condition 3 already excludes the trivial case of a file
    with no accents at all.

    Cost, measured on a 646 KB page: 0.115 ms for the decode attempt
