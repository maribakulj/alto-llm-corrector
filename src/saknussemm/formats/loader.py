"""Namespace-driven format detection and the generic manifest builder (§3).

The document says what it is: each file's root namespace selects the
ALTO or PAGE parser — nobody passes a format flag. One format per
document (a mixed ALTO+PAGE batch has no single rewriter).

Any host ingesting user files should build its manifest through this
module rather than importing a format-specific parser, because a parser
asked for the wrong format finds nothing rather than objecting. Half of
that trap is now closed and half is not, so the halves are worth
distinguishing: :func:`alto.parser.build_document_manifest` sniffs each
file and *refuses* a non-ALTO one, while :func:`alto.parser.parse_alto_file`
still returns an empty page list for a valid PAGE file — 0 pages, no
error, a silent mis-read. A host calling the single-file entry point
directly is still on its own.

``saknussemm.load()`` (the facade) is this module plus
basename bookkeeping; hosts that carry their own (path, source_name)
pairs and a :class:`PairingPolicy` call :func:`build_document_manifest`
directly.

    no derivable adapter, and silently assuming one — the historical ALTO
    default — is exactly how a PAGE document ended up rewritten by the
    ALTO rewriter.

    Lives next to :func:`build_document_manifest` because the two answer
    the same question: which module speaks this format. In
    ``core/provenance.py`` it was the one place the pure core enumerated
    ALTO and PAGE by name — lazily, so no import rule was broken, but the
    knowledge was there and a third format
    would have had to be added to a core module to be usable.

    The imports stay function-local: this module is reached from ``core``
    lazily too (``core/rendering.py``, the single remaining lazy site),
    and eager adapter imports would pull both rewriters for a run that
    writes one format.
