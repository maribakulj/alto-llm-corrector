"""Ask an LLM for a whole page at once, and put the answer back on its lines.

The engine's two modes differ in **who holds line identity**:

============  ==========================  ========  ========  ======
mode          identity held by            calls     tokens    cost
============  ==========================  ========  ========  ======
line-keyed    the JSON contract, per line   ~2 000    5.49 M   $1.11
page-aligned  the alignment, after the      **28**  **0.39 M** **$0.14**
              fact
============  ==========================  ========  ========  ======

Measured on the 24 592-line Gallica corpus. The saving is not cleverness: the
line-keyed envelope carries ``prev_text`` and ``next_text`` with every line,
so each line's text travels three times, and the JSON around it weighs 7.9×
the text itself.

**Everything this producer gives up is paid in one place.** The answer has no
line ids, so the mapping is recovered by
:func:`~saknussemm.core.page_alignment.align_page_lines`, whose docstring
holds the measurements and the refusals. This module's job is to not undo any
of them:

- A line the alignment will not vouch for produces **no op**, so it keeps its
  OCR text. Hence ``requires_full_coverage = False`` — an uncovered line here
  is an expected outcome (1.6% on the worst real page), not a degraded
  response to retry. Declaring ``True`` would fail every page over lines the
  engine already knows how to leave alone.
- A response of the wrong shape, or an alignment that ran out of corridor, is
  a **malformed response**: raised, retryable, counted. Not silently turned
  into zero edits, which would report a clean run that corrected nothing.
